# PGX v1.0.0 README file
# Intro
This is PGX, a simple libary built on top of `pygame`. It is designed for beginners to start making Python-based games easily.

# Installation
Go to the [PGX Repository](https://github.com/ACoder735/PGX)

Click the green Code button and select Download ZIP.

Extract the ZIP file.

Find the PGX folder inside.

Copy the PGX folder into your Python Lib/site-packages/ folder.

# Starting Up

`PGX` is a simple Library with lots of functionaliy.

Let's start our first PGX program. Before you do this, install PGX (info in the **Installation** chapter.)

First, type this:
```
import PGX  # We initalize PGX so we can use it

win = PGX.Window(800, 600) # Create a window that's 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high

win.run() # The most important function; it runs the window and game
```
This code makes a blank window.

See? It's simple! Instead of having to do pygame's game loop, you just type `win.run()` and PGX handles everything for you.

More of PGX's feutures are:
- Simple shapes 
- Sprites and sprite groups
- Camera
- Collisons and physics
- And more
